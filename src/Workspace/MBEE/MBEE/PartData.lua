When powered, the gyro will follow its seek commands that can be configured using hammer. The gyro has commands that allow it to find and seek objects and players.  An example of gyro\'s seek configuration includes \'Player1 Player2\' which will seek and aim towards the nearest player.  Putting \'Radar\' at the beginning of the seek configuration will make it target parts instead. For example, \'Radar Gold Copper\' will find the nearest Gold or Copper deposit.  Putting \'AllExcept\' will make the seeker target everything except the given list, basically inverting it. For example, \'AllExcept Player1 Player2\' will target \'Player3\' or \'Player\'4 but not \'Player1\'.  The commands \'Min\' and \'Max\' set the minimum or maximum distance the seeker will target. For example, \'Min20 Max500\' will make the seeker only target objects within 500 studs and more than 20 studs away.  TriggerWhenSeeked will trigger all connected parts every second when the Seek configurable is satisfied  \'TrigMin\' and \'TrigMax\' work the same as \'Min\' and \'Max\' but it\'s for the trigger signal, trigger signal will only be sent if the above property is true.  Putting \'Sun\' as part of the list will make the seeker automatically target the main stellar body in the system.  Gyros also have a property called MaxTorque.

This means that you can connect a relay to your main base, warp away without anyone in the base, and still have the relay get the sufficient amount of power.  However, you should have only one sending relay per coordinate, as conflicts can occur if there are 2 or more relays in the region/coordinates sending power or signals with the same ID. On the other hand, there can be an infinite number of receivers but the power/resources will be distributed evenly among them.  For example, let\'s say a relay network has a total output of 500 power and 25 iron. If there are 5 active receivers, each of them will get 100 power and 5 iron.

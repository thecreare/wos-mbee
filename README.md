## History
The original [MBTools](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/6724254977) was developed by [Austism](https://www.roblox.com/users/52134822/profile) and later by [Hexcede](https://www.roblox.com/users/35904028/profile).
[MBE](https://www.roblox.com/library/10075508989/WoS-MBTools-EDITED) is a fork of Austism's MBTools, created by [Crenbow](https://www.roblox.com/users/306951138/profile/). It added quite a few quality of life features but was unfortunatly retried when Crenbow left. [MBEE](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/11707735968) is the latest itteration and is primarily developed by [creare](https://www.roblox.com/users/857491600/profile).
